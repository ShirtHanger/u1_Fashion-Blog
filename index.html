            <p>How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. This is your world. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Let's have a little bit of fun today.</p>

            <p>You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Brown is such a nice color. Just make little strokes like that. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Let's get crazy. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.</p>
